		<h1>Green Bay Packers</h1>
		<h2>A notably badass football team</h2>
	</div>
	<main>
		<p>A fine, organic, sustainable pack of monsters dedicated to getting the football into the endzone. The Green Bay Packers should be your favorite team, even if you live in one of those places that isn't Wisconsin!</p>
		<h3>Historic Legacy</h3>
		<p>The Green Bay Packers were organized on August 11th, 1919, and have since won 13 NFL Championships, making them the leaders in the league. The next team down doesn't even come close with their pitiful 9!</p>
		<p>The small town team almost didn't survive the early financial challenges of the big leagues, until the owner of a local newspaper rallied the people of Green Bay to purchase the team, creating the nonprofit Green Bay Football Corporation. For the last century and to this day, the Packers have been owned by their fans!</p>

		<h3>Distinctive Culture</h3>
		<p>Owning a real stake one's team can inspire a fierce loyalty, sometimes bordering on lunacy. Just look at <a target="_blank" href="https://eof737.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/agreenbaypackercheesehead.jpg?w=300" alt="Green Bay Packers Cheese Head Hat">this Hat</a>! Indeed the great state of Wisconsin, brimming with cheese and all covered in snow, has given us a team to be proud of.</p>
